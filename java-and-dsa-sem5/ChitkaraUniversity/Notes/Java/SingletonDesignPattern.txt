Singleton Design Pattern is a class design which allows only 1 instance of a class to be made.

There are 2 types:
    1. Eager Instantiation
        - already creates an instance of the class at runtime, no matter the instance object is needed/used or not
    2. Lazy Instantiation
        - crates the instance when required
        - several ways to do it, each with its own benefits and drawbacks
