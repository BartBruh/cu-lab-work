Is your algorithm a best fit?


Time complexity:
    - deals with the amount of time required by the algorithm or program to execute to completion.


Space Complexity:
    - deals with the amount of memory required in a system for a particular algorithm

    Space complexity = Auxiliary Space + Space taken by input values.


Importance of time and space complexity in data structures:
