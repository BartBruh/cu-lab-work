- Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table by using a hash function.
- It is done for faster access to elements.
- The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.

Let a hash function H(x) maps the value x at the index x%10 in an Array.
If the list of values is [11,12,13,14,15] it will be stored at positions {1,2,3,4,5} in the array or Hash table respectively.



Collision:
    2 values try to get set at the same index in hashing
    Eg.
        5 at index 5 i.e. 5 % 10 = 5
        15 at index 5 i.e. 15 % 10 = 5
        both try to get stored at index 5

2 ways of dealing with collisions:
    Open Hashing - ?
        - Separate Chaining
    Closed Hashing - Open Addressing Collision Handling technique
        1.  Linear Probing
        2.  Quadratic Probing
        3.  Double Hashing
