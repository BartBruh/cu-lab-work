- When it's required to make a sequence of choices to achieve a global optimum.
- At each stage, make the next choice based on some local criterion.
- Never go back and revise an earlier decision.
- Drastically reduces space to search for solutions.

Example Algorithms:
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - Prim's Algorithm
    - ...

Example Problems:
    - Largest Number Problem
    - Coin Change Problem
    - Interval Scheduling Problem
    - Job Sequencing Problem with Deadline
    - Fractional Knapsack Problem
    - Huffman Coding
