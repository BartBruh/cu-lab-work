STRING SEARCH ALGORITHMS

KMP - Knuth-Morris-Pratt:

The problem with the naive approach is that when it discovers a mismatch,
it moves to th next position in the text T,
and starts comparing the word W from the beginning.

The KMP algorithm performs some analysis on the word W
before trying to find its occurrences in the text T.

- It works on the proper prefix (from LHS) and proper suffix (from RHS).
- It uses a pre-generated table called a prefix table or pie table or longest proper prefix table.
- A prefix table helps to skip certain comparisons.

In simple, we can say, KMP is an improved version of the Naive Algorithm for the haystack with a needle appearing ...?
