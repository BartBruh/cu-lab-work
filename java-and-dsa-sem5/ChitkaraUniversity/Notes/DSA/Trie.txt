A trie is an ordered data structure, a type of search tree used to store associative data structures.

Wikipedia Definition:
In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree or prefix tree,
is a type of k-ary search tree,
a tree data structure used for locating specific keys from within a set.
These keys are most often strings,
with links between nodes defined not by the entire key,
but by individual characters.

A compressed trie is essentially a tree data structure
with an additional rule that every node has to have two or more children.

A trie is pronounced "try", although the name trie is derived from "retrieval".

The trie data structure is well-suited to matching algorithms,
as they are based on the prefix of each string.
Tries are typically employed for solving problems of matching and retrieval,
where strings are associated with keys and values.

But what exactly is a trie?

Tries are neglected data structures, found in books but rarely in standard libraries.

A trie is a tree-like data structure
where in the nodes of the tree store the entire alphabet,
and strings/words can be re*trie*ved by traversing down branch path of the tree.

In order to access a key (to recover its value, change it, or remove it),
the trie is traversed depth-first, following the links between nodes,
which represent each character in the key.
