NEVER CHANGE IMPLEMENTATION IN ANY ALGO FOR ANYTHING YOU NEED TO DO!

If ever asked to sort an array in descending order,
    - NEVER change the algorithm itself.
    - Instead, use a container like a stack to put in values in ascending order and then values are popped out in descending order.
    - Don't use any inbuilt methods like reverse() after sorting using some sorting algorithms either,
        or a point arises that they could have used the inbuilt sort() method in the first place,
        but they're looking for your approach.

1. Bubble Sort:
    - Bubble sort is a basic sequential sorting algorithm.
    - It sorts by comparing neighboring elements and swaps them if they are out of order.
    - If 'n' is the side of input, Bubble Sort requires 'n-1' passes to sort n elements.
    - It works by swapping the two adjacent elements of an array if they're in the wrong order.
