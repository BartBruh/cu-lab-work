Quick Sort
    - select a pivot element from start or end
    - do the partitioning and place the pivot element at its correct position
    - recursive call of the quicksort() to the leftover left and right portions of the pivot element

Merge Sort
    - recursively split array from middle and send the left and right halves to merge sort function
    - combine the sorted partitions after the recursive call
    - stop recursion when size reaches <= 1

Heap Sort
    - requires learning about Heapify
