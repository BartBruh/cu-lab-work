PROJECT MANAGEMENT METRICS:
	The Management Spectrum:
	4 Ps - 4 Aspects Of Project Management:
		People
		Product
		Process 
		Project

	Software Metrics:
		3 Division Groups:
			Process Metrics
			Product Metrics
			Project Metrics

		How To Measure Effectiveness Of Software Process

		Project Metrics

		Product Metrics

		Types Of Software Measurements:
			Exampe

		Normalization of Metrics

PROJECT PLANNING:
	5 Major Activities:
		Estimation
		Scheduling
		Risk Analysis
		Quality Management Planning
		Change Management Planning

	Project Planning Process

	Task Set for Project Planning:
		Establish Project Scope
		Determine Feasibility
		Analyze Risks
		Define Required Resources
		Estimate Cost and Effort
		Develop a Project Schedule

	Estimation

	Software Scope

	Feasibility

	Resource Estimation:
		Major Categories:
			1. People (Human Resources)
			2. Reusable Software Components
			3. Development Environment (Hardware & Software Tools)

		Each resource specified with 4 characteristics:
			Description of resource
			Statement of availiability
			When the resource will be required
			Duration of time that resource will be applied

	Software Project Estimation

EMPIRICAL ESTIMATION MODELS
	COCOMO Model
	(Constructive Cost Model)

	3 different COCOMO models reflecting the complexity:
		1. Basic COCOMO Model
		2. Intermediate COCOMO Model
		3. Detailed COCOMO Model (same as Complete?)

	Basic COCOMO Model:
		small to medium sized software projects
		quick and rough estimates
		3 Modes of Software Development considered:
			Organic
			Semi-detached
			Embedded

	COCOMO Some Assumptions

	Basic COCOMO Model Formula

	Basic COCOMO Model Equation

	Basic COCOMO Model Example

	COCOMO II (Revised COCOMO):
		Categories identified:
			End User Programming
			Infrastructure Sector
			Intermediate Sectors

		3 Levels of COCOMO II
		- allowing increasingly detailed estimates to be prepared as development progresses
			Early Prototyping Level/Application Composition

			Early Design Level

			Post-architecture Level
