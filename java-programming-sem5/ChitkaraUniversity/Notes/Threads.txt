main method itself is a thread

It is never legal to start a thread more than once.

The following Thread methods were mentioned in the docs because they were planned
- but they were never implemented and have been deprecated.
    - Thread.stop(),
    - Thread.destroy(),
    - Thread.suspend(),
    - Thread.resume()
Thread.destroy() especially was never even planned

All of these were made to stop or pause Threads, but later it was decided Threads shouldn't be able to do it.
Threads can be interrupted, but not paused in the middle.

Difference between Thread.start() and Thread.run():
    - when program calls start() method a new Thread is created and code inside run() method is executed in new Thread
    - while if you call run() method directly no new Thread is created and code inside run() will execute on current Thread

Thread thread = new Thread();
thread.start();
    ^ this doesn't give any error
    because in method definition - if target is null the run method doesn't get executed
