Multithreading is driven by the core concept of a Thread.

THREAD LIFE CYCLE:
The java.long.Thread class contains a static State enum - which defines its potential states. During any given point of time, the thread can only be in one of these states:
    6 Thread States:
    - NEW
        - a newly created thread that has not yet started the execution
    - RUNNABLE
        - either running or ready for execution, but it's waiting for resource allocation
    - BLOCKED
        - waiting to acquire a monitor lock to enter or re-enter a synchronized block/method
    - WAITING
        - waiting for some other thread to perform a particular action without any time limit
    - TIMED_WAITING
        - waiting for some other thread to perform a specific action for a specified period
    - TERMINATED
        - has completed its execution
