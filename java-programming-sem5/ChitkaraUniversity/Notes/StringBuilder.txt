STRING BUILDER WAS INTRODUCED IN JAVA 1.5
STRING BUILDER WAS RECOMMENDED OVER STRING BUFFER SINCE JAVA 1.5

STRING BUILDER IS NOT SYNCHRONISED WHILE MANY METHODS OF STRING BUFFER ARE SYNCHRONISED
SYNCHRONISED - WAIT IN EVENT QUEUE I.E. YOU CAN REALLY ONLY USE ONE THREAD

STRING BUILDER IS NOT THREAD-SAFE, STRING BUFFER IS THREAD-SAFE

STRING BUILDER IS FASTER THAN STRING BUFFER BECAUSE IT IS NOT SYNCHRONISED AND NOT THREAD-SAFE



IF YOU CREATE StringBuilder WITH NEW KEYWORD I.E. WITH STRING IN CONSTRUCTOR,
THEN LENGTH GETS ADDED TO INITIAL CAPACITY AND OBJECT STARTS WITH THAT CAPACITY

WHEN LENGTH EXCEEDS CAPACITY, IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES CAPACITY AS:
new_capacity = (old_capacity*2)+2;
