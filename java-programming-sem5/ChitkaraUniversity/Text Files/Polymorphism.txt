Polymorphism that is resolved during compile time is known as static polymorphism.
Polymorphism that is resolved during run time is known as dynamic polymorphism.

Method overloading is used in static polymorphism.
Method overriding is used in dynamic polymorphism.

In Summary:
Static Polymorphism = Compile Time Polymorphism > Method Overloading
Dynamic Polymorphism = Run Time Polymorphism > Method Overriding
