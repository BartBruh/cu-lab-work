var
global scope
redeclaration (not initialization) allowed
variable hoisting (var is treated as if declared at top but not initialized)

let
block (curly braces) scope
no redeclaration (not initialization) allowed
no variable hoisting

const
same as let but value can't be changed here
no variable hoisting
has to be initialized along with declaration or gives error since const assumes the value is not to be changed so it should be specified already
