-- AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS, USER ACCOUNTS (Grant and Revoke), COMMIT AND ROLLBACK

-- AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
-- A function is a set of instructions that can be used to perform a specific task

-- creating table
-- create table orders (oid int, amount int, address varchar(50), cid int, sid int);

-- insert into orders values (1, 10000, 'US', 2, 3);
-- insert into orders values (2, 20000, 'UK', 3, 4);
-- insert into orders values (3, 30000, 'AU', 4, 5);

-- select * from orders;

-- APPLYING AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
-- select sum(amount) from orders;
-- select min(amount) from orders;
-- select max(amount) from orders;
-- select avg(amount) from orders;
-- select count(amount) from orders;


-- USER ACCOUNTS IN DBMS
-- won't work on livesql or MySQL Command Line Client directly because it requires administrator (root) user to execute the command to grant rights to another user (not database)
-- grant select, update on orders to akhil;
-- revoke select on orders from akhil;


-- ROLLBACK and COMMIT
-- ROLLBACK undos transactions and reverses data to values from last commit
-- COMMIT permanently saves data in database that cannot be changed reversed through rollback
-- won't work in livesql or our independent machines because rollback and commit are for distributed dbms servers and systems
-- select * from orders;
-- commit;
-- update orders set amount = 40000 where oid = 2;
-- select * from orders;
-- rollback;
-- select * from orders;
