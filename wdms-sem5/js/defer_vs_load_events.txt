JS Events Difference:

DOMContentLoaded - the whole document (HTML) has been loaded, without waiting for resources to finish loading.
load - the whole document and its resources (e.g. images, iframes, scripts) have been loaded.


(not sure about this below)
We don't need to use DOMContentLoaded event when using defer attribute in script tag, because the script will be executed after the DOMContentLoaded event.
