Main points about JavaScript:
- Interpretable
- High level programming language
- Client and Server Side
- lightweight language
- supports many framework
- works in sync with other languages 

- Uses
  - web application & mobile application (React native)
  - Deploying of Server
  - Games with libraries
  - interactive web pages
  - Forms interactive 

- Faster Execution and light weight
- reduce server load - execute code on client side before sharing to Server
- Audio and Video playing 

- Node js is used in backend-side of server


Keywords used to declare variables:
- var
  - function scope (not global scope)
  - redeclaration allowed
  - redefinition allowed
  - variable hoisting (var is treated as if declared at top but not initialized)

- let
  - block (curly braces) scope
  - redeclaration not allowed
  - redefinition allowed
  - no variable hoisting

- const
  - same as let but value can't be changed here i.e. immutable
  - block (curly braces) scope
  - redeclaration not allowed
  - redefinition not allowed
  - has to be initialized along with declaration or gives error since const assumes the value is not to be changed so it should be specified already
  - no variable hoisting


Variable Names:
- can start with $, _, letters
- can't start with numbers

How does JS know type?
- Dynamic Type Setting
- it will decode itself the type of variable
  

Data Types:
  1. Primitive
  - String
  - Number
  - Boolean
  - Undefined
  - Null/NaN
  - BigInt - n at last of number. Eg: 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n
  - Symbol

  2. Non-Primitive:
  - Object
  - Array
  - RegEx(s)

Difference between Null, Undefined and NaN:
  - Null - Null represents an empty value and carry no meaningful information.
  - Undefined - Undefined represents any value that has not been defined anywhere in the program. If any variable or operation isn't able to produce a meaningful value, it returns undefined.
  - NaN - NaN stands for Not a Number. You get this value when you try to do some operation that can't yield a meaningful result.
